    While, I was at Kareo, I had the opportunity to do something that I wanted to do for a long time:
    redesign a medical bill.
</p>

<h2>Early Thinking</h2>
<p>
    Before I started designing any workflows or screens, I asked myself a lot of questions about
    what role personal health records (PHRs) serve and how we can deliver them to patients. I began
    by looking at how PHRs, patients, and providers interacted. One of our goals was to increase patient
    health awareness by making health information easy to get to and easy to understand.
</p>
<p>
    For practices, our goal was to increase patient responsiblity payments. In 2010, the US healthcare
    industry <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/JPM-KeyTrends-in-HealthcarePatientPayments.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320610345938&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs">wrote off $65 billion</a> in bad debt accrued from not collecting patient payments. For our
    customers, the problem lies in archaic payment practices, which we hoped to innovate with Patient Portal.

<h2>Levels and Dimensions</h2>
<p>
    Now that I had a framework for prioritizing questions, I needed to actually design something
    to answer them. I experimented with complex query-like interfaces and powerful comparison
    visualizations. But these felt to complicated and didn't offer the obvious defaults that I
    wanted. I didn't want publishers to put in a lot of effort to get answers. So I tried to work
    out the inventory data between two axes: levels and dimensions. A level is a scope of inventory,
    like a placement (1 piece of inventory) or a website (a collection of inventory). A dimension
    is a lens to view that level.
</p>

<p>
    The way I described it to my team is with a metaphorical set of binoculars. Imagine you have a
    pair of high-tech binoculars and you're looking at a mountain. The binoculars are first set at
    the widest possible aperture so you can see the whole mountain and the field in the foreground.
    You can then turn a dial to zoom in on the mountain. You can zoom in all the way until just the
    peak is in view. These are levels. Another dial on the binoculars allows you to see the mountain
    through different wavelengths. The default is the visible spectrum but turn this dial and you
    can see the mountain in UV, infrared, and radio wavelengths. These dimensions can tell you a
    much richer story than visible light alone.
</p>
<p>
    Levels and Dimensions is a clear framework for thinking about publisher reporting. It also feels
    very <strong>safe</strong>. Reporting interfaces sometimes lead you down a rabbit hole or can
    feel intimidating. With this reporting design, you usually know where you stand and what you're
    looking at. It's easy to navigate and easy to get questions answered.
</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
    We didn't include any complex reporting tools like comparing levels across different time periods
    to find growth or comparing dimensions to find patterns. I'd like to figure out a clean way to complete
    these tasks.

        Another early prototype that showed data in aggregate and comparison mode. Comparing some
        elements doesn't make business sense. For example, comparing websites that target different
        audiences or that have different business objectives might not be valuable.

<p>
    The other major piece of design work that feels missing from this is <strong>in-context actions</strong>. If
    I see that fill rates are down or placement eCPMs are not where I'd like them to be, I need to take some action:
    adjust placement floor rate, turn on new demand sources, maybe create new inventory. How do I do that? Those actions
    should be rolled into reporting somehow.
